MERN Stack Chatbot

A full-stack chatbot application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that integrates with the OpenAI API for chat completion. This project features user authentication, a dynamic chat interface, and state management via the Context API.

Features -
Chatbot: Integrates OpenAI's GPT models to generate responses based on user input.
Authentication: Secure user login and registration using JWT and bcrypt.
State Management: Global state handling using React's Context API for efficient data flow and user session management.
Responsive UI: Built with React for a seamless user experience across devices.
Backend API: Node.js and Express handle server-side logic and interact with MongoDB to manage user sessions and queries.

Technologies Used-

Frontend:
React: For building the user interface.
React Router DOM: For handling navigation between routes.
Context API: For managing global application state (authentication and chat state).
Tailwind CSS / Material UI: For styling and responsive design.

Backend:
Node.js & Express: For creating the backend API and handling requests.
MongoDB & Mongoose: For storing user data and managing queries.
JWT (JsonWebToken): For secure authentication and session management.
bcrypt: For hashing user passwords.
OpenAI API: To integrate the chatbot's natural language processing.

Additional Libraries:
dotenv: For environment variable management.
Morgan: For logging HTTP requests.
Concurrently: For running the frontend and backend servers simultaneously during development.
